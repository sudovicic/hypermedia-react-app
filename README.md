## About

This project was created as part of the course _Hypermedia User Experience Engineering_ by _Interactive Media_ students of the Hagenberg Campus at University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria.

## Setup

- Run `npm install` to install deps
- Run `npm start` to start the dev server

That's it!

## Goals

We wanted to create a fully client-side implementation of a simple movie list management application that would require neither a remote server nor any user authentication/authorization.
The project depends on [an unofficial IMDb API](https://github.com/SpEcHiDe/IMDbOT) and persists certain data to localStorage.
